# Customer churn - a predictive model using Apache Spark framework

## Context

With the rapid development of telecommunication industry, the service providers are inclined more towards expansion of the subscriber base. To meet the need of surviving in the competitive environment, the retention of existing customers has become a huge challenge. It is stated that the cost of acquiring a new customer is far more than that for retaining the existing one. Therefore, it is imperative for the telecom industries to use advanced analytics to understand consumer behavior and in-turn predict the association of the customers as whether or not they will leave the company.

## What is customer churn?

Simply put, customer churn occurs when **customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service**. Also known as customer attrition, customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers – earning business from new customers means working leads all the way through the sales funnel, utilizing your marketing and sales resources throughout the process. Customer retention, on the other hand, is generally more cost-effective as you’ve already earned the trust and loyalty of existing customers.
